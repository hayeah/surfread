Once or twice she had peeped into the\n\t\tbook her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \"and what\n\t\tis the use of a book,\" thought Alice, \"without pictures or conversations?\"</p>\n\n\t\t<p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the day made her\n\t\tfeel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be\n\t\tworth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit\n\t\twith pink eyes ran close by her.</p>\n\n\t\t<figure class=\"small\">\n\t\t\t<img src=\"images/i002_th.jpg\" alt=\"Illo2\" />\n\t\t</figure>\n\n\t\t<p>There was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it so\n\t\t<a id=\"Page_4\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 4]\"></a>very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit\n\t\tsay to itself, \"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\" But when the Rabbit actually\n\t\ttook a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, Alice\n\t\tstarted to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a\n\t\trabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and, burning with\n\t\tcuriosity, she ran across the field after it and was just in time to see it pop down a\n\t\tlarge rabbit-hole, under the hedge. In another moment, down went Alice after it!</p>\n\n\t\t<p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly\n\t\tdown, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before\n\t\tshe found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time,\n\t\tas she went down, to look about her. First, she tried to make out what she was coming\n\t\tto, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well and\n\t\tnoticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw\n\t\tmaps and <a id=\"Page_5\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 5]\"></a>pictures hung upon pegs. She\n\t\ttook down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed. It was labeled \"ORANGE\n\t\tMARMALADE,\" but, to her great disappointment, it was empty; she did not like to drop\n\t\tthe jar, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Down, down, down! Would the fall never come to an end? There was nothing else to do,\n\t\tso Alice soon began talking to herself. \"Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should\n\t\tthink!\" (Dinah was the cat.) \"I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time.\n\t\tDinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me!\" Alice felt that she was dozing off,\n\t\twhen suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\n\t\tthe fall was over.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up in a moment. She looked up, but it was\n\t\tall dark overhead; before her was another long passage and the White Rabbit was still\n\t\tin sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost. Away went Alice like the\n\t\twind and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \"Oh, my ears and\n\t\twhiskers, how late it's getting!\" She was close behind it when she turned the corner,\n\t\tbut the Rabbit was no longer to be seen.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>She found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\n\t\tfrom the roof. There were doors all 'round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\n\t\tAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she\n\t\twalked sadly down the middle, <a id=\"Page_6\" class=\"pageno\" title=\n\t\t\"[Pg 6]\"></a>wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p>\n\n\t\t<figure class=\"small\">\n\t\t\t<img src=\"images/i003_th.jpg\" alt=\"Illo3\" />\n\t\t</figure>\n\n\t\t<p>Suddenly she came upon a little table, all made of solid glass. There was nothing on\n\t\tit but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first idea was that this might belong to one of\n\t\tthe doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too\n\t\tsmall, but, at any rate, it would not open any of them. However, on the second time\n\t\t'round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a\n\t\tlittle door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock, and\n\t\tto her great delight, it fitted!</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger\n\t\tthan a rat-hole; she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden\n\t\tyou ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those\n\t\tbeds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\n\t\tthrough the doorway. \"Oh,\" said Alice, \"how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I\n\t\tthink I could, if I only knew how to begin.\"</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Alice went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\n\t\tany rate, a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes. This time she<a id=\n\t\t\"Page_7\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 7]\"></a> found a little bottle on it (\"which\n\t\tcertainly was not here before,\" said Alice), and tied 'round the neck of the bottle was\n\t\ta paper label, with the words \"DRINK ME\" beautifully printed on it in large\n\t\tletters.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\"No, I'll look first,\" she said, \"and see whether it's marked '<i>poison</i>' or\n\t\tnot,\" for she had never forgotten that, if you drink from a bottle marked \"poison,\" it\n\t\tis almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. However, this bottle was\n\t\t<i>not</i> marked \"poison,\" so Alice ventured to taste it, and, finding it very nice\n\t\t(it had a sort of mixed flavor of cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffy\n\t\tand hot buttered toast), she very soon finished it off.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\"What a curious feeling!\" said Alice. \"I must be shutting up like a telescope!\"</p>\n\n\t\t<p>And so it was indeed! She was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up\n\t\tat the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into\n\t\tthat lovely garden.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>After awhile, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the\n\t\tgarden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! When she got to the door, she found she had\n\t\tforgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found\n\t\tshe could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass and\n\t\tshe tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery,\n\t\tand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and\n\t\tcried.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\"Come, there's no use in crying like that!\" said Alice to herself rather sharply. \"I\n\t\tadvise you to<a id=\"Page_8\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 8]\"></a> leave off this minute!\"\n\t\tShe generally gave herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it), and\n\t\tsometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened\n\t\tit and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \"EAT ME\" were beautifully\n\t\tmarked in currants. \"Well, I'll eat it,\" said Alice, \"and if it makes me grow larger, I\n\t\tcan reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so\n\t\teither way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!\"</p>\n\n\t\t<p>She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself, \"Which way? Which way?\" holding\n\t\ther hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was growing; and she was quite\n\t\tsurprised to find that she remained the same size. So she set to work and very soon\n\t\tfinished off the cake.</p>\n\n\t\t<figure class=\"small\">\n\t\t\t<img src=\"images/i004_th.jpg\" alt=\"Illo4\" />\n\t\t</figure>\n\n\t\t<p><a id=\"Page_9\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 9]\"></a></p>\n\n\t</section>\n</body>\n</html>\n"

Good-by, feet! Oh, my poor little\n\t\tfeet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I shall be\n\t\ta great deal too far off to trouble myself about you.\"</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>Just at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall; in fact, she was\n\t\tnow rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and\n\t\thurried off to the garden door.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through\n\t\tinto the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever. She sat\n\t\tdown and began to cry again.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>She went on shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all 'round her\n\t\tand reaching half down the hall.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>After a time, she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily\n\t\tdried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly\n\t\tdressed, with a pair of white kid-gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other.\n\t\tHe<a id=\"Page_10\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 10]\"></a> came trotting along in a great\n\t\thurry, muttering to himself, \"Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! <i>won't</i> she be\n\t\tsavage if I've kept her waiting!\"</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"small\">\n\t\t\t<img src=\"images/i005_th.jpg\" alt=\"Illo5\" />\n\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>When the Rabbit came near her, Alice began, in a low, timid voice, \"If you please,\n\t\tsir&#8212;\" The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid-gloves and the fan and\n\t\tskurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>Alice took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all the time she went\n\t\ton talking. \"Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on\n\t\tjust as usual. <i>Was</i> I the same when I got up this morning? But if I'm not the\n\t\tsame, the next question is, 'Who in the world am I?' Ah, <i>that's</i> the great\n\t\tpuzzle!\"</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>As she said this, she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had\n\t\tput on one of the Rabbit's little white kid-gloves while she was talking. \"How\n\t\t<i>can</i> I have done that?\" she thought. \"I must be growing small again.\" She got up\n\t\tand went to the table to measure herself by it and found that she was now about two\n\t\tfeet high and was going on<a id=\"Page_11\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 11]\"></a> shrinking\n\t\trapidly. She soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she\n\t\tdropped it hastily, just in time to save herself from shrinking away altogether.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\"That <i>was</i> a narrow escape!\" said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden\n\t\tchange, but very glad to find herself still in existence. \"And now for the garden!\" And\n\t\tshe ran with all speed back to the little door; but, alas! the little door was shut\n\t\tagain and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before. \"Things are\n\t\tworse than ever,\" thought the poor child, \"for I never was so small as this before,\n\t\tnever!\"</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>As she said these words, her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up\n\t\tto her chin in salt-water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea.\n\t\tHowever, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\n\t\tshe was nine feet high.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"small\">\n\t\t\t<img src=\"images/i006_th.jpg\" alt=\"Illo6\" />\n\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she\n\t\tswam nearer to see what it was: she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\n\t\tslipped in like herself.<a id=\"Page_12\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 12]\"></a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\"Would it be of any use, now,\" thought Alice, \"to speak to this mouse? Everything is\n\t\tso out-of-the-way down here that I should think very likely it can talk; at any rate,\n\t\tthere's no harm in trying.\" So she began, \"O Mouse, do you know the way out of this\n\t\tpool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!\" The Mouse looked at her rather\n\t\tinquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said\n\t\tnothing.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\"Perhaps it doesn't understand English,\" thought Alice. \"I dare say it's a French\n\t\tmouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\" So she began again: \"O&#249; est ma\n\t\tchatte?\" which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\n\t\tsudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright. \"Oh, I beg your\n\t\tpardon!\" cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings. \"I\n\t\tquite forgot you didn't like cats.\"</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\"Not like cats!\" cried the Mouse in a shrill, passionate voice. \"Would <i>you</i>\n\t\tlike cats, if you were me?\"</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\"Well, perhaps not,\" said Alice in a soothing tone; \"don't be angry about it. And\n\t\tyet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah. I think you'd take a fancy to cats, if you\n\t\tcould only see her. She is such a dear, quiet thing.\" The Mouse was bristling all over\n\t\tand she felt certain it must be really offended. \"We won't talk about her any more, if\n\t\tyou'd rather not.\"</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\"We, indeed!\" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of its tail. \"As if\n\t\t<i>I</i> would talk on such a subject! Our family always <i>hated</i> cats<a id=\n\t\t\"Page_13\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 13]\"></a>&#8212;nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't\n\t\tlet me hear the name again!\"</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"full\">\n\t\t\t<img src= \"images/plate02_th.jpg\" alt=\"Alice at the Mad Tea Party.\" title=\"Alice at the Mad Tea Party.\" />\n\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Alice at the Mad Tea Party.</p>\n\t\t\t</figcaption>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\"I won't indeed!\" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\n\t\tconversation. \"Are you&#8212;are you fond&#8212;of&#8212;of dogs? There is such a nice\n\t\tlittle dog near our house, I should like to show you! It kills all the rats\n\t\tand&#8212;oh, dear!\" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone. \"I'm afraid I've offended it\n\t\tagain!\" For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making\n\t\tquite a commotion in the pool as it went.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>So she called softly after it, \"Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk\n\t\tabout cats, or dogs either, if you don't like them!\" When the Mouse heard this, it\n\t\tturned 'round and swam slowly back to her; its face was quite pale, and it said, in a\n\t\tlow, trembling voice, \"Let us get to the shore and then I'll tell you my history and\n\t\tyou'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\"</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and\n\t\tanimals that had fallen into it; there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet,\n\t\tand several other curious creatures. Alice led the way and the whole party swam to the\n\t\tshore.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"small\">\n\t\t\t<img src=\"images/i007_th.jpg\" alt=\"Illo7\" />\n\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p><a id=\"Page_14\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 14]\"></a></p>\n\t\t\n\t</section>\n</body>\n</html>\n"

This is the driest\n\t\t\tthing I know. Silence all 'round, if you please! 'William the Conqueror, whose cause\n\t\t\twas favored by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and\n\t\t\thad been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.

The question is, what did the archbishop find?\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \"'&#8212;found it\n\t\t\tadvisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown.'&#8212;How\n\t\t\tare you getting on now, my dear?\" it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"As wet as ever,\" said Alice in a melancholy tone; \"it doesn't seem to dry me at\n\t\t\tall.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"In that case,\" said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \"I move that the meeting\n\t\t\tadjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies&#8212;\"<a id=\"Page_16\"\n\t\t\tclass=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 16]\"></a></p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Speak English!\" said the Eaglet. \"I don't know the meaning of half those long\n\t\t\twords, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"What I was going to say,\" said the Dodo in an offended tone, \"is that the best\n\t\t\tthing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"What <i>is</i> a Caucus-race?\" said Alice.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figure class=\"small\">\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"images/i009_th.jpg\" alt=\"Illo9\" />\n\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Why,\" said the Dodo, \"the best way to explain it is to do it.\" First it marked out\n\t\t\ta race-course, in a sort of circle, and then all the party were placed along the\n\t\t\tcourse, here and there. There was no \"One, two, three and away!\" but they began running\n\t\t\twhen they liked and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the\n\t\t\trace was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite\n\t\t\tdry again, the Dodo suddenly called out, \"The race is over!\" and they all crowded\n\t\t\t'round it, panting and asking, \"But who has won?\"<a id=\"Page_17\" class=\"pageno\" title=\n\t\t\t\"[Pg 17]\"></a></p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought. At last it\n\t\t\tsaid, \"<i>Everybody</i> has won, and <i>all</i> must have prizes.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"But who is to give the prizes?\" quite a chorus of voices asked.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Why, <i>she</i>, of course,\" said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and\n\t\t\tthe whole party at once crowded 'round her, calling out, in a confused way, \"Prizes!\n\t\t\tPrizes!\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand into her pocket and\n\t\t\tpulled out a box of comfits (luckily the salt-water had not got into it) and handed\n\t\t\tthem 'round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all 'round.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>The next thing was to eat the comfits; this caused some noise and confusion, as the\n\t\t\tlarge birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and\n\t\t\thad to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last and they sat down again in a\n\t\t\tring and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"You promised to tell me your history, you know,\" said Alice, \"and why it is you\n\t\t\thate&#8212;C and D,\" she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended\n\t\t\tagain.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Mine is a long and a sad tale!\" said the Mouse, turning to Alice and sighing.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"It <i>is</i> a long tail, certainly,\" said Alice, looking down with wonder at the\n\t\t\tMouse's tail, \"but why do you call it sad?\" And she kept on puzzling about it while the\n\t\t\tMouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:<a id=\n\t\t\t\"Page_18\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 18]\"></a>&#8212;</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"poem stanza\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"i1\">\"Fury said to<br /></span> <span class=\"i2\">a mouse,\n\t\t\t\tThat<br /></span> <span class=\"i3\">he met in the<br /></span> <span class=\"i4\">house,\n\t\t\t\t'Let<br /></span> <span class=\"i5\">us both go<br /></span> <span class=\"i6\">to law:\n\t\t\t\t<i>I</i><br /></span> <span class=\"i6 c9\">will prosecute<br /></span> <span class=\n\t\t\t\t\"i6 c9\"><i>you</i>.&#8212;<br /></span> <span class=\"i6 c9\">Come, I'll<br /></span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"i5 c9\">take no denial:<br /></span> <span class=\"c20\"><span class=\n\t\t\t\t\"i4 c9\">We must have<br /></span> <span class=\"i3 c10\">the trial;<br /></span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"i2 c10\">For really<br /></span> <span class=\"i1 c10\">this\n\t\t\t\tmorning<br /></span> <span class=\"i0 c10\">I've<br /></span> <span class=\n\t\t\t\t\"i0 c10\">nothing<br /></span> <span class=\"i0 c11\">to do.'<br /></span> <span class=\n\t\t\t\t\"i1 c11\">Said the<br /></span> <span class=\"i2 c11\">mouse to<br /></span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"c19\"><span class=\"i3 c11\">the cur,<br /></span> <span class=\n\t\t\t\t\"i4 c11\">'Such a<br /></span> <span class=\"i5 c12\">trial, dear<br /></span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"i6 c12\">sir, With<br /></span> <span class=\"i8 c12\">no jury<br /></span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"i9 c12\">or judge,<br /></span> <span class=\"i9 c12\">would<br /></span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"i8 c13\">be wasting<br /></span> <span class=\"i7 c13\">our<br /></span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"c18\"><span class=\"i5 c13\">breath.'<br /></span> <span class=\n\t\t\t\t\"i4 c13\">'I'll be<br /></span> <span class=\"i3 c13\">judge,<br /></span> <span class=\n\t\t\t\t\"i2 c14\">I'll be<br /></span> <span class=\"i1 c14\">jury,'<br /></span> <span class=\n\t\t\t\t\"i0 c14\">said<br /></span> <span class=\"i0 c14\">cunning<br /></span> <span class=\n\t\t\t\t\"i1 c14\">old<br /></span> <span class=\"i2 c15\">Fury;<br /></span> <span class=\n\t\t\t\t\"c17\"><span class=\"i3 c15\">'I'll<br /></span> <span class=\"i4 c15\">try<br /></span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"i5 c15\">the<br /></span> <span class=\"i6 c15\">whole<br /></span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"i7 c16\">cause,<br /></span> <span class=\"i7 c16\">and<br /></span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"i6 c16\">condemn<br /></span> <span class=\"i5 c16\">you to<br /></span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"i3 c16\">death.'\"<br /></span></span></span></span></span>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p><a id=\"Page_19\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 19]\"></a>\"You are not attending!\" said the\n\t\t\tMouse to Alice, severely. \"What are you thinking of?\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"I beg your pardon,\" said Alice very humbly, \"you had got to the fifth bend, I\n\t\t\tthink?\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"You insult me by talking such nonsense!\" said the Mouse, getting up and walking\n\t\t\taway.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Please come back and finish your story!\" Alice called after it.

The Duchess! Oh, my dear paws! Oh, my fur and\n\t\t\twhiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where <i>can</i> I\n\t\t\thave dropped them, I wonder?\" Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan\n\t\t\tand the pair of white kid-gloves and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for\n\t\t\tthem, but they were nowhere to be seen&#8212;everything seemed to have changed since\n\t\t\ther swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had\n\t\t\tvanished completely.<a id=\"Page_21\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 21]\"></a></p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, and called to her, in an angry tone, \"Why, Mary\n\t\t\tAnn, what <i>are</i> you doing out here? Run home this moment and fetch me a pair of\n\t\t\tgloves and a fan! Quick, now!\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"He took me for his housemaid!\" said Alice, as she ran off. \"How surprised he'll be\n\t\t\twhen he finds out who I am!\" As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on\n\t\t\tthe door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \"W. RABBIT\" engraved upon it.\n\t\t\tShe went in without knocking and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet\n\t\t\tthe real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and\n\t\t\tgloves.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>By this time, Alice had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the\n\t\t\twindow, and on it a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid-gloves; she took up\n\t\t\tthe fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room, when her eyes\n\t\t\tfell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. She uncorked it and put it\n\t\t\tto her lips, saying to herself, \"I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for, really,\n\t\t\tI'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the\n\t\t\tceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the\n\t\t\tbottle, remarking, \"That's quite enough&#8212;I hope I sha'n't grow any more.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Alas! It was too late to wish that! She went on growing and growing and very soon\n\t\t\tshe had to kneel down on the floor. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource,\n\t\t\tshe put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney, and said to\n\t\t\therself,<a id=\"Page_22\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 22]\"></a> \"Now I\t can do no more,\n\t\twha\ttev\ter happens. What <i>will</i> become of me?\"</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"small\">\n\t\t\t<img src=\"images/i012_th.jpg\" alt=\"Illo12\" />\n\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>Luckily for Alice, the little mag\tic b\tottle had now had its full effect and she grew\n\t\t\tno larger. After a few minutes she hear\td a voice outside and stopped to listen.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Mary Ann! Mary Ann!\" said the voice\t. \"Fetch me my gloves this moment!\" Thencame a\n\t\t\tlittle pattering of feet on the stairs. \tAlice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for\n\t\t\ther and she trembled till she shoo\tk th\te house, quite forgetting that she was now about\n\t\t\ta thousand times as large as the \tRabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Presently the Rabbit came up\t to the door and tried to open it; but as the door\n\t\t\topened inwards and Alice's\t elbow was press\ted h\tard against it, that attempt proved a\n\t\t\tfailure. Alice heard it sayto itself, \"Then I'll g\to 'round and get in at the\n\t\t\twindow.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"<i>That</i> you won't!\" thought Ali\tce; and after waiting till she fancied she heard\n\t\t\tthe Rabbit just under the window, sh\te suddenly spread out her hand and<a id=\"Page_23\"\n\t\t\tclass=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 23]\"></a\t> made asnatch in the air. She did not get hold of\n\t\tanything, but she heard a little s\thriek and a fall and a crash of\t bro\tken glass, from\n\t\twhich she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a c\tucumber-frame or\n\t\t\tsomething of that sort.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Next came an angry voice&#8212;the Rabbit's&#8212;\"\tPat!Pat! Where are you?\" And\n\t\t\tthen a voice she had never heard before, \"Sure t\then, I'm here! D\tiggi\tng for apples, yer\n\t\t\thonor!\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Here! Come and help me out of this!

This time\n\t\t\tthere were <i>two</i> little shrieks a\tnd more sounds of brok\ten g\tlass. \"I wonder what\n\t\t\tthey'll do next!\" thought Alice. \"As for pulling me out of the wi\tndow, I only wish they\n\t\t\t<i>could</i>!\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>She waited for some time without h\tearing anything more. At last came a rumbling of\n\t\t\tlittle cart-wheels and the sound of a \tgood many voices all talking together. She made\n\t\t\tout the words: \"Where's the other lad\tder? Bill's got the other&#8212;Bill! Here, Bill!\n\t\t\tWill the roof bear?&#8212;Who's to g\to do\twn the chimney?&#8212;Nay, <i>I</i> sha'n't!\n\t\t\t<i>You</i> do it! Here, Bill! The master s\tays you've got to go down the chimney!\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Alice drew her foot as far down the c\thimney as she couldand waited till she heard a\n\t\t\tlittle animal scratching and scrambling a\tbout in the chimney close above\t\n\t\t\t<a id=\"Page_24\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 24]\"></a> her; then she gave one sharp kick\t and waited to see\n\t\t\twhat would happen next.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>The first thing she heard was a\t general chorus of \"There goes Bill!\" then the\n\t\t\tRabbit's voice alone&#8212;\"Catc\th him, you by the hedge!\" Then silence a\tnd t\then another\n\t\t\tconfusion of voices&#8212;\"Hold up his head&#8212;Brandy now&#8212;Don\t't choke\n\t\t\thim&#8212;What happened to you?\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Lastcame a little f\teeble, squeaking voice, \"Well, I hardly know&#8212;No mor\te,\n\t\t\t\tthank ye. I'm better now&#8212;all I know is, something comes at me like a\n\t\t\tJack-in-the\t-box and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Afte\tr a \tminute or two of silence, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the\n\t\t\tRabbit say\t, \"A barrowful will do, to begin with.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"A barrowful of <i>what</i>?\" though\tt Alice. But she had not long to doubt, for the\n\t\t\tnext moment a shower of little pe\tbbles came rattling in at the window and some of them\n\t\t\thither in the face. Alice no\tticed, with some surprise, that the pebbles were all\n\t\t\tturning into little cakes as they \tlay on the floor and\t abr\tight idea came into her\n\t\t\thead. \"If Ieat one of these cakes,\" she thought, \"it's sure to m\take <i>some</i> change\n\t\t\tin my size.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>So she swallowed one of the cakes an\td was delighted to find that she began shrinking\n\t\t\tdirectly. As soon as she was small \tenough to get through the door, she ran out of the\n\t\t\thouse and found quite a crowd of lit\ttle animals and birds waiting outside. They all\n\t\t\t\tm\tade a rush at Alice the moment she ap\tpeared, but she ran off as hard \tas she could and\n\t\t\tsoon found herself safe in a thick wood.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figure class=\"full\">\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"images/plate03_th.jpg\" alt=\"The Duchess tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's.\" title=\n\t\t\t\t\"The Duchess tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's.\" />\n\t\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"The Duchess \ttucked her arm affectionately into Alice's.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\t</figcaption>\n\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"The first thing I've got to do,\" said Alice to herself, <a id=\"Page_25\" class=\n\t\t\t\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 25]\"></a>as she wande red about in the wood, \"is to grow to my right\n\t\t\tsize again; and the second thing i\ts to find my way into that lovely garden.

I should like to be a <i>little</i> larger, sir, if you\n\t\t\twouldn't mind,\" said Alice. \"Three inches is such a wretched height to be.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"It is a very good height indeed!\" said the Caterpillar an\tgrily, rearing itself\n\t\t\tupright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).<a id=\"Page_28\" class=\"pageno\"\n\t\t\ttitle=\"[Pg 28]\"></a></p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>In a minute or two, the Caterpillar got down off the mushroom and crawled away in\tto\n\t\t\t\tthe grass,merely remarking, as it went, \"One side will make you grow taller, and the\n\t\t\tother side will make you grow shorter.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"One side of <i>what</i>?

At last she stretched her arms 'round it as far as they\n\t\t\twould go,\t and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"And now which is which?\" she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the\n\t\t\tright-hand bit to trythe effect. The next moment she felt a violent blow underneath\n\t\t\ther chin&#8212;it had struck her foot!</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>She was a gooddeal frightened b\ty this very sudden change, as she was shrinking\n\t\t\trapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\n\t\t\tso closely against her\t foo\ttthat there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did\n\t\t\tit at last and managed to s\twallow a morsel of the left-hand bit....</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Come, my head's free at last!\" said Alice; but all she could see, when she loo\tked\n\t\t\t\tdown, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of\n\t\t\t\tgreen leaves that lay far below her.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Where <i>have</i> my shoulders got to? And oh, mypoor hands, how is it I can't see\n\t\t\tyou?\"Shewas de<a id=\"Page_29\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 29]\"></a>lighted to find that\n\t\t\ther neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just\n\t\t\tsucceeded in curving it down into a gr\taceful zigzag and was going to dive inamong the\n\t\t\tleaves, when a s\tharp\t hiss made her draw back in a hurry &#8212;a large pigeon had flo\twn\n\t\t\tinto her face and\t was\t beating her violently with its wings.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figure class=\"small\">\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"images/i015_th.jpg\" alt=\"Illo15\" />\n\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Serpent!\" cried the Pigeon.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"I'm <i>not</i> a serpent!\" said Alice indignantly. \"Let me alone!\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"I've tried the\t roo\tts of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've\t tri\ted hedges,\" the\n\t\t\tPigeon went on, \"but those serpents! There's no pleasing them!\"</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Alice was more and more puzzled.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,\" said the Pigeon, \"but I must be\n\t\t\ton the look-out for serpents, night and day! And just as I'd taken the highest tree in\n\t\t\tthe wood,\" continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, \"and just as I was\n\t\t\tthinkingI should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the\n\t\t\tsky! Ugh, Serpent!\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"But I'm <i>not</i> a serpent, I \ttell you!\" said Alice. \"I'm a&#8212;I'm a&#8212;I'm\n\t\ta little girl,\" she added rather<a id=\"Page_30\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 30]\"></a>\n\t\t\tdoubtfully, as she remembered the numbe\tr of changes she had gone through that day.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<p>\"You're looking for eggs, I know <i>that</i> well enough,\" said the Pigeon; \"and\n\t\t\twhat does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a serpent?\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"It matters a good deal to <i>me</i>,\" said Alice h\tastily; \"but I'm not looking for\n\t\t\teggs, as it happens, and if I was, I shouldn't want <i>yours</i>&#8212;I don't like\n\t\t\tthem raw.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Well, be off, then!\" said the Pige\ton in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into\n\t\tits nest. Alice crouched down a\tmong the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept\n\t\tgetting entangled among the bra\tnches, and every now and then she had to stop and\n\t\tuntwist it. After awhile she rememb\tered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in\n\t\t\ther hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the\n\t\t\tother, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in\n\t\t\tbringing herself down to her usual height.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>It was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite\n\t\t\t\tstrange at first. \"The next thing is to get into that beautiful garden&#8212;how\n\t\t\t\t<i>is</i> that to be done, I wonder?\" As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open\n\t\t\t\tplace, with a little house in it about four feet high. \"Whoever lives there,\" thought\n\t\t\t\tAlice, \"it'll never do to come upon them <i>this</i> size;why, I should frighten them\n\t\t\t\tout of their wits!\" She did not venture to go near the house till she had brought\n\t\t\therself down to nine inches high.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p><a id=\"Page_31\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 31]\"></a></p>\n\t</section>\n</body>\n</html>\n"

It was opened by another footman in livery,with a round face and large eyes\n\t\tlike a frog.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"small\">\n\t\t\t<img src=\"images/i015_th.jpg\" alt=\"Illo15\" />\n\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, and this he\n\t\thanded over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, \"For the Duchess.<a id=\"Page_32\"\n\t\tclass=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 32]\"></a> An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.\" The\n\t\tFrog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, \"From the Queen. An invitation for the\n\t\tDuchess to play croquet.\" Then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled\n\t\ttogether.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>When Alice next peeped out, the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on\n\t\tthe ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky. Alice went timidly up to\n\t\tthe door and knocked.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\"There's no sortof use in knocking,\" said the Footman, \"and that for two reasons.\n\t\tFirst, because I'm on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they're\n\t\tmaking such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.\" And certainly there\n\t\t<i>was</i> a most extraordinary noise going on within&#8212;a constant howling and\n\tsneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken\n\tto pieces.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\"How am I to get in?\" asked Alice.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\"<i>Are</i> you to get in at all?\" said the Footman. \"That's the first question, you\n\t\tknow.\"</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>Alice opened the door and went in. The door led right into a large kitchen, which\n\t\twas full of smoke from one end to the other; the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged\n\t\tstool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a\n\tlarge caldron which seemed to be full of soup.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\"There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!\" Alice said to herself, as well as\n\t\tshe could for sneezing. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and asforthe baby, it\n\t\twas sneezing and howling alternately without a moment'spause. The only two\n\t\tcreatures<a id=\"Page_33\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 33]\"></a> in the kitchen that did\n\t\t<i>not</i> sneeze were the cook and a large cat, which was grinning from ear to\n\t\tear.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\"Please would you tell me,\" said Alice, a little timidly, \"why your cat grins like\n\t\tthat?\"</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\"It's a Cheshire-Cat,\" said the Duchess,\"and that's why.\"</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\"I didn't know that Cheshire-Cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats\n\t\t<i>could</i> grin,\" said Alice.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\"You don't know much,\" said the Duchess, \"and that's a fact.\"</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>Just then the cook took the caldron of soupoff the fire, and at once set to work\n\t\tthrowing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby&#8212;the fire-irons\n\t\tcame first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates and dishes. The Duchess took no\n\t\tnotice of them, even when they hit her, and the baby was howling so much already that\n\t\titwas quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\"Oh, <i>please</i> mind what you're doing!\" cried Alice, jumping up and down in an\n\t\tagony of terror.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\"Here! You may nurse it a bit, if you like!\" the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the\n\t\tbaby at her as she spoke. \"I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,\" and\n\tshe hurried out of the room.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature\n\t\tand held out its arms and legs in all directions. \"If I don't take this child away with\n\t\tme,\" thought Alice, \"they're sure to kill it in a day or two. Wouldn't it be murder to\n\t\tleave it behind?\" She said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in\n\t\treply.<a id=\"Page_34\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 34]\"></a></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\"If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,\" said Alice, \"I'll have nothing more\n\t\tto do with you. Mind now!\"</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>Alice was just beginning to think to herself, \"Now, what am I to do with this\n\t\tcreature, when I get it home?\" when it grunted again so violently that Alice looked\n\t\tdown into its face in some alarm. This time there could be <i>no</i> mistake about\n\t\tit&#8212;it was neither more nor less than a pig; so she set the little creature down\n\t\tand felt quite relieved to see it trot awayquietly into the wood.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>Alice was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire-Catsitting on a bough of a tree\n\ta few yards off. The Cat only grinned when it saw her. \"Cheshire-Puss,\" began Alice,\n\t\trather timidly, \"would you please tell me which way I ought to gofrom here?\"</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\"In <i>that</i> direction,\" the Cat said, waving the right paw 'round, \"lives a\n\t\tHatter; and in <i>that</i> direction,\" waving the other paw, \"lives a March Hare. Visit\n\t\teither you like; they're both mad.\"</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\"But I don't want to go among mad people,\" Alice remarked.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\"Oh, you can't help that,\" said the Cat; \"we're all mad here. Do you play croquet\n\t\twith the Queen to-day?\"</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\"I should like it very much,\" said Alice, \"but I haven't been invited yet.\"</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\"You'll see me there,\" said the Cat, and vanished.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>Alice had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March\n\t\tHare; it was so large a house that she did not like to go near till she had nibbled\n\t\tsome more of the left-hand bit of mushroom.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p><a id=\"Page_35\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 35]\"></a></p>\n\t\n\t</section>\n</body>\n</html>\n"

Suddenly their eyes chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them.\n\t\t\t\"Would you tell me, please,\" said Alice, a little timidly, \"why you are painting those\n\t\t\troses?\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Five and Seven said nothing, butlooked at Two.<a id=\"Page_38\" class=\"pageno\" title=\n\t\t\t\"[Pg 38]\"></a> Twobegan, in a low voice, \"Why, the fact is, you see, Miss, this here\n\t\t\tought to have been a <i>red</i> rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and,\n\t\t\tif the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you\n\t\t\tsee, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to&#8212;\" At this moment, Five, who\n\t\t\thad been anxiously looking across the garden, called out, \"The Queen! The Queen!\" and\n\t\t\tthe three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound\n\t\t\tof many footstepsand Alice looked 'round, eager to see the Queen.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>First came ten soldiers carrying clubs, with their hands and feet at the corners:\n\t\t\tnext the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds. After these came\n\t\t\tthe royal children; there were ten of them, all ornamented with hearts. Next came the\n\t\t\tguests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognized the White Rabbit. Then\n\t\t\tfollowed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion;\n\t\t\tand last of all this grand procession came THE KING AND THE QUEEN OF HEARTS.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and\n\t\t\tthe Queen said severely, \"Who is this?\" She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only\n\t\t\tbowed and smiled in reply.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"My name is Alice, so please Your Majesty,\" said Alice very politely; but she added\n\t\t\tto herself, \"Why, they're only a pack of cards, after all!\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Can you play croquet?\" shouted the Queen. The question was evidently meant for\n\t\t\tAlice.<a id=\"Page_39\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 39]\"></a></p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Yes!\" said Alice loudly.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Come on, then!\" roared the Queen.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"It's&#8212;it's a very fine day!\" said a timid voice to Alice. She was walking by\n\t\t\tthe White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Very,\" said Alice. \"Where's the Duchess?\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Hush! Hush!\" said the Rabbit. \"She's under sentence of execution.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"What for?\" said Alice.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"She boxed the Queen's ears&#8212;\" the Rabbit began.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Get to your places!\" shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began\n\t\t\trunning about in all directions, tumbling up against each other. However, they got\n\t\t\tsettled down in a minute or two, and the game began.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was\n\t\t\tall ridges and furrows. The croquet balls were live hedgehogs, and the mallets live\n\t\t\tflamingos and the soldiers had to double themselves up and stand on their hands and\n\t\t\tfeet, to make the arches.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>The players all played at once, without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while\n\t\t\tand fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time, the Queen was in a furious\n\t\t\tpassion and went stamping about and shouting, \"Off with his head!\" or \"Off with her\n\t\t\thead!\" about once in a minute.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here,\" thought Alice; \"the great wonder\n\t\t\tis that there's anyone left alive!\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>She was looking about for some way of escape, when she noticed a curious appearance\n\t\t\tin the air.<a id=\"Page_40\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 40]\"></a> \"It's the Cheshire-Cat,\"\n\t\t\tshe said to herself; \"now I shall have somebody to talk to.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"How are you getting on?\" said the Cat.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"I don't think they play at all fairly,\" Alice said, in a rather complaining tone;\n\t\t\t\"and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak&#8212;and they don't\n\t\t\tseem to have any rules in particular.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"How do you like the Queen?\" said the Cat in a low voice.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Not at all,\" said Alice.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figure class=\"small\">\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"images/i018_th.jpg\" alt=\"Illo18\" />\n\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on. So she\n\t\t\twent off in search of her hedgehog. The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another\n\t\t\thedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them\n\t\t\twith the other; the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other\n\t\t\tside of the garden, where Alice could see it trying, in a helpless sort of way, to fly\n\t\t\tup into a tree. She caught the flamingo and tucked it away under her arm, that it might\n\t\t\tnot escape again.<a id=\"Page_41\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 41]\"></a></p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Just then Alice ran across the Duchess (who was now out of prison). She tucked her\n\t\t\tarm affectionately into Alice's and they walked off together. Alice was very glad to\n\t\t\tfind her in such a pleasant temper. She was a little startled, however, when she heard\n\t\t\tthe voice of the Duchess close to her ear. \"You're thinking about something, my dear,\n\t\t\tand that makes you forget to talk.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"The game's going on rather better now,\" Alice said, by way of keeping up the\n\t\t\tconversation a little.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"'Tis so,\" said the Duchess; \"and the moral of that is&#8212;'Oh, 'tis love, 'tis\n\t\t\tlove that makes the world go 'round!'\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Somebody said,\" Alice whispered, \"that it's done by everybody minding his own\n\t\t\tbusiness!\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Ah, well! It means much the same thing,\" said the Duchess, digging her sharp little\n\t\t\tchin into Alice's shoulder, as she added \"and the moral of <i>that</i> is&#8212;'Take\n\t\t\tcare of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves.'\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>To Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's arm that was linked into hers began to\n\t\t\ttremble. Alice looked up and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms\n\t\t\tfolded, frowning like a thunderstorm!</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Now, I give you fair warning,\" shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she\n\t\t\tspoke, \"either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time. Take your\n\t\t\tchoice!\" The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Let's go on with the game,\" the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much\n\t\t\tfrightened to say a<a id=\"Page_42\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 42]\"></a> word, but slowly\n\t\t\tfollowed her back to the croquet-ground.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>All the time they were playing, the Queen never left off quarreling with the other\n\t\t\tplayers and shouting, \"Off with his head!\" or \"Off with her head!\" By the end of half\n\t\t\tan hour or so, all the players, except the King, the Queen and Alice, were in custody\n\t\t\tof the soldiers and under sentence of execution.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and walked away with Alice.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Alice heard the King say in a low voice to the company generally, \"You are all\n\t\t\tpardoned.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Suddenly the cry \"The Trial's beginning!\" was heard in the distance, and Alice ran\n\t\t\talong with the others.</p>\n\t\t\n\t</section>\n</body>\n</html>\n"

In the\n\t\t\tvery middle of the court<a id=\"Page_43\" class=\"pageno\" title=\"[Pg 43]\"></a> was a\n\t\t\ttable, with a large dish of tarts upon it. \"I wish they'd get the trial done,\" Alice\n\t\t\tthought, \"and hand 'round the refreshments!\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figure class=\"small\">\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"images/i019_th.jpg\" alt=\"Illo19\" />\n\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>The judge, by the way, was the King and he wore his crown over his great wig.\n\t\t\t\"That's the jury-box,\" thought Alice; \"and those twelve creatures (some were animals\n\t\t\tand some were birds) I suppose they are the jurors.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Just then the White Rabbit cried out \"Silence in the court!\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Herald, read the accusation!\" said the King.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>On this, the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, then unrolled the\n\t\t\tparchment-scroll and read as follows:</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"poem stanza\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"i0\">\"The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,<br /></span> <span class=\n\t\t\t\t\"i2\">All on a summer day;<br /></span> <span class=\"i0\">The Knave of Hearts, he stole\n\t\t\t\tthose tarts<br /></span> <span class=\"i2\">And took them quite away!\"<br /></span>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Call the first witness,\" said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on\n\t\t\tthe trumpet and called out, \"First witness!\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>The first witness was the Hatter.
